   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` File**:
   - In the project directory, create a `.env` file for any necessary configurations (e.g., API keys):

   ```plaintext
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```
**Change this to your need**:

    INITIAL_RESPONSE="Hello! How can I assist you today?"
    
    INITIAL_MSG="Welcome to Field Focus!"
    
    CHAT_CONTEXT="You are a helpful assistant knowledgeable about sports gear and equipment."
